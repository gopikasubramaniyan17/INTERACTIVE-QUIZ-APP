##1. Introduction

As part of my internship task, I developed an Interactive Quiz Application using basic web technologies. The purpose of this project is to allow users to answer multiple-choice questions, receive instant feedback for each answer, and view their final score at the end of the quiz. The application is designed to be simple, easy to understand, and user-friendly while still meeting all the requirements given during the internship.

This project focuses on understanding the fundamentals of frontend development and how different web technologies work together to create an interactive application.

2. Development Environment and Editor Used

For developing this project, I used Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as my primary code editor. VS Code is a popular editor widely used for web development because it is lightweight, fast, and easy to use. It provides features such as syntax highlighting, file organization, and easy debugging, which helped me during development.

The project files were organized properly to maintain clarity:

index.html for structure

style.css for design and layout

script.js for functionality and logic

Testing was done directly in the web browser to verify the output after each change.

3. Technologies Used

The following technologies were used to build the quiz application:

3.1 HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

HTML was used to create the basic structure of the quiz application. It defines elements such as headings, question display area, option buttons, and navigation buttons. The layout was kept simple so that users can easily understand and interact with the quiz.

3.2 CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

CSS was used to improve the appearance of the application. Basic styling such as background colors, font styling, margins, padding, and button design was applied. A gradient background and colored buttons were used to make the application visually attractive without making it too complex.

3.3 JavaScript

JavaScript was used to add interactivity to the quiz. It controls question loading, answer checking, score calculation, and final result display. JavaScript also ensures that the user cannot select more than one answer for a question and cannot move to the next question without answering the current one.

4. Working of the Quiz Application

The quiz questions are stored in a JavaScript array. Each question contains the question text, multiple answer options, and the correct answer. When the quiz starts, the first question is loaded dynamically from this array.

When the user selects an option, the application immediately checks whether the selected answer is correct. If the answer is correct, the option turns green and the score increases. If the answer is wrong, the option turns red and the correct answer is highlighted. After selecting an option, all other options are disabled to prevent multiple selections.

The Next button allows the user to move forward only after answering the current question. This ensures proper quiz flow and avoids skipping questions.

5. Scoring and Feedback System

The application maintains a score variable that keeps track of the user’s correct answers. At the end of the quiz, the final score is displayed along with performance feedback.

The feedback is given based on the score obtained:

Excellent Performance for high scores

Good Job for average scores

Need Improvement for low scores

This feedback helps users understand their performance clearly.

6. Testing and Debugging

During development, the application was tested multiple times to identify errors and logical issues. Problems such as multiple option selection and incorrect score calculation were fixed by improving the JavaScript logic. Continuous testing helped ensure that the application runs smoothly without errors.

7. Conclusion

This project helped me gain practical knowledge of frontend web development. I learned how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create an interactive web application. I also learned how to handle user inputs, manage application flow, and provide instant feedback. The Interactive Quiz Application successfully meets all the internship requirements and serves as a strong foundation for future web-based projects.
